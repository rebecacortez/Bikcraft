## About
The **Bikcraft** project was developed during the **Web Design** course at **[Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/)**. During the course, I learned all the basics of **UI/UX Design** and **coding**, putting all the concepts into practice by developing **from wireframe to design** and finally, ** site code** from **Bikcraft**, a company that sells custom made-to-measure bikes, where we develop concepts like **semantic HTML**, **optimization** of images and CSS files, **SEO** and usage **Google Analytics**.
Later, during the **CSS with SASS** course, a **reverse engineering** of the project was carried out, using **imports** to better organize the project and updating the grid system using **loops **, in addition to the use of **variables** of colors and **mixins** for the different typographies of the project.
